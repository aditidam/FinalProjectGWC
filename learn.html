      <h3> Neutrogena Foaming Face Scrub  </h3>
      <p style="border:6px; border-style:dotted; border-color:"black";> Neutrogena foaming soap contains microbeads as an exfoliant, 
        however these microbeads are known as polyethylene. They transport phenanthrene 
        which is a by product of a fossil fuel, and a  toxic ocean pollutant. These microbeads 
        cannot be broken down. Even more concerning, it ends up in the sewage system and
        remain there which causes it to end up in bodies of waters and can be eaten by 
        marine animals. This product deeply affects humans and the food chain. </p>
